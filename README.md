 * Question:- What is Swing in JAVA?
 * Answer:- Swing in java is part of Java foundation class which is lightweight and platform independent.
 * It is used for creating window based applications. It includes components like button, scroll bar, text field etc.
 * Putting together all these components makes a graphical user interface.

 1.Read_UTF - The DataInputStream class provides a String readUTF( ) and String readUTF(DataInput in) methods to
 read a UTF8 encoded string from its underlying input stream.

 2. Write_UTF - The DataOutputStream class provides a void writeUTF( ) method that encodes a string into UTF8 format.
 It first writes the number of encoded bytes in the string (as an unsigned short) followed by the UTF-8 encoded format
 of the string onto the underlying output stream.
